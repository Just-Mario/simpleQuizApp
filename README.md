# simpleQuizApp

This simple quiz app is just a small application built with the intention to showcase the little grasp I have on Javascript-
Ecma Script 6 (2015). I feel that this modern approach is less complicated and induces clean coding practices. let and const-
variable declarations in addition to var keyword brings about a great feature of Block scope where a variable lexical environment-
still matters however there's little work we have to do as far as the execution is concerned. Aero functions promote concise/clean code
and is time effective.

I aim to dig deeper into JAVASCRIPT ES6 and later.

This is just the beginning of learning.

#ThankYou.
